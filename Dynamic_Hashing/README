  Exercise 5: Dynamic Hashing
*/


INCLUDED FILES:-
Makefile
README
exercise5.cpp
hash_table.h
linked_list.h
dynarray.h


MAKEFILE TARGETS:-
1) make all
2) exercise5: Builds the executable file
3) exercise5.o: Compiles the exercise5.cpp and create the object file exercise5.o
4) clean: Removes all object files and executables.


RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS:-
Once you are in the file directory just use the make command
make
Then the make will compile exercise5.cpp
and creates the object files for exercise5.cpp files
and then creates the excituable file by the object files
and the name of excituable file name is exercise5
After using it if you want to clean the object files run
make clean


NOTES AND ASSUMPTIONS:-
1) Assuming that we can add private method to the hash_table class
2) Considering we need to only resize when we have crossed
the number of items > number of buckets
3) Assuming that we should not give the user to specify the number of buckets
