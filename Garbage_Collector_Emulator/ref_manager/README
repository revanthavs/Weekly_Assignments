	Exercise 3: Garbage Collector Emulator
*/

INCLUDED FILES:-
Makefile
README
ref_manager.cpp
ref_manager.h
we3_test.cpp

MAKEFILE TARGETS:-
1) make all
2) we3_solution: Builds the executable file
3) we3_test.o: Compiles the we3_test.cpp and create the object file we3_test.o
4) ref_manager.o: Compiles the ref_managercpp and creates the object file ref_manager.o
5) clean: Removes all object files and executables.

RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS:-
Once you are in the file directory just use the make command
make
Then the make first will compile ref_manager.cpp and we3_test.cpp
and creates the object files for both .cpp files
and then creates the excituable file by linking both the object files
and the name of excituable file name is we3_solution
After using it if you want to clean the object files run
make clean

NOTES AND ASSUMPTIONS:-
1) I added a new attribute private garbage_i to keep track of the elements
added to the garbage array.
2) Considering the NULL to be the element not to keep track of in refCount.
Since, it's not the memory to free
3) Assuming in the destrutor method to ignore the element at that index if
it's pointing to NULL
4) Assuming in the garbagecollector method no element will be deleted if it's
pointing to NULL
5) I added #include <cassert> in ref_manager.cpp to avoid the error as one of the TA's mentioned in the
Annoucments
